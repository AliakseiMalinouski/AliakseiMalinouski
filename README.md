### Hi! ðŸ‘‹


## My name is Aliaksei, I am 19 years old. I am a junior Front-end developer. I have been doing web development for almost a year. My learning journey began in March 2021. I started with a website development course based on HTML, CSS, also SAAS/SCSS and JavaScript. During this course, which lasted four months, I realised that web development was exactly what I wanted to do, something that gave me great pleasure. Immediately after the layout course, I took a course in JavaScript web application development. It wasn't easy, but it was a very interesting and challenging course that lasted almost five months. My graduation project was a games library (in the My web project repository), where the user could explore the library, the games, register and finally play the game of their choice. I successfully completed the JavaScript course before the deadline and realised that I needed to move on, so even before graduation I started my React study in courses. At the moment I'm studying React, expanding my portfolio, at the same time repeating my favourite JavaScript, and, of course, looking for a job.
